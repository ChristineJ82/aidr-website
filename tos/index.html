<h1><a href="../">AIDR</a>: Terms of Service</h1>

<p>This document describes our policy regarding the data we collect and the privacy of our users.</p>

<h2>For administrators (aidr.qcri.org)</h2>

<p>You can use AIDR for humanitarian and crisis response purposes. We hope it is useful to you, but we provide it without any implied or explicit warranty. While we make an effort to provide a reliable service at aidr.qcri.org, your collections may be stopped or removed at any time. We are unlikely to keep your data from collections that are inactive for more than 7 days. You are welcome to <a href="https://github.com/qcri-social/AIDR">grab the source code</a> (distributed under the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html">AGPL 3.0 license</a>) and run your own instance of AIDR.</p>

<p>By using aidr.qcri.org, you grant us permission to use all the data you collect &mdash;including all the labels you obtain&mdash; for research on humanitarian computing and crisis computing. This includes permission to re-distribute your collections to other organizations working on humanitarian response, crisis response, and/or doing research on these topics. Redistribution of collections based on data obtained through Twitter's API will be done respecting Twitter API's terms of service. If you do not want your data to be reused or redistributed, please contact us before starting your collection.</p>

<p>The AIDR team fully endorses <a href="http://iRevolution.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/icrc-prof-protection-standards-english-final-2013.pdf">ICRC's Data Protection Protocols</a> and <a href="https://docs.unocha.org/sites/dms/Documents/Humanitarianism%20in%20the%20Cyberwarfare%20Age%20-%20OCHA%20Policy%20Paper%2011.pdf">UN's Guidelines on Cyber Security</a>. Users of the AIDR platform should familiarize themselves with both documents, and respect international standards on data privacy, security, and protection.</p>

<h2>For digital volunteers (clickers.micromappers.org)</h2>

<p>The content you will work with is selected automatically from user-generated content. As such, it may content profanity and/or graphic or disturbing images or descriptions.</p>

<p>Creating an account is optional. You can be an anonymous digital volunteer if you prefer. If you create an account, you can choose to use your real name or a pseudonym, and you can choose to use a profile photo or not. If you provide a name and/or photo, this may be displayed on the digital volunteers site, on a leaderboard or other public forum.</p>
<p>All the labels you provide to AIDR will be made public. When distributing these labels, we will replace your account name with an account number, but we provide no guarantee that this cannot be traced back to your account name.</p>
<h2>NO WARRANTIES</h2>

<p>AIDR IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITH NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF ANY KIND AND WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AVAILABILITY, SECURITY, TITLE AND/OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. YOUR USE OF AIDR IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE THAT RESULTS FROM THE USE OF AIDR, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM, LOSS OF DATA, OR ANY OTHER LOSS.</p>

<p>WE WILL NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH USE OF AIDR. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AGREE TO HOLD HARMLESS AND INDEMNIFY AIDR DEVELOPERS AND SUPPORTERS OF ANY THIRD PARTY CLAIM ARISING FROM OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO YOUR USE OF AIDR (INCLUDING ANYTHING YOU DEVELOP USING AIDR).</p>

<h2>These terms may change</h2>

<p>We will notify you through our <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/aidr-users">aidr-users</a> mailing list if these terms of service change. Please contact
